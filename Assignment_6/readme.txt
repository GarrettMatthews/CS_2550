I used JSON to simulate a saved game state. You can see the saved game state by clicking "Load Game". This is done on the game grid. It will load a saved game state and the score. This is located in saved_game.json .
The array connected with savedGame is the saved grid; the integer connected with savedScore is the saved score.
