                Moving up kind of works- it will move up if there is a similar number next to it, but
                it won't move into an empy space yet. The code I tried for that didn't work at all, 
                so I had to scrap that for now. For some reason though, down, left, and right don't 
                want to work yet, so I'm not sure there
